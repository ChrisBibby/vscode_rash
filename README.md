# rash README

This VSCode extension provides the ability to calculate SHA256 and MD5 hashes for files via the file explorer. After a hash is calculated, it is copied to the clipboard.

The extension does not support the calculating of hashes for folders or multiple files.

**Notes**
The hashing of text selection is not yet implemented.
